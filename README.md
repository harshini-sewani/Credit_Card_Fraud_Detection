# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Credit Card fraud detection is very important nowadays since all new companies are growing around the world. All these are trying to provide good service quality to their customers. Companies are maintaining a dataset for each customer based on daily transactions. So, it is very important to keep the data stored. Since any misuse of this data can harm individuals as well as companies.

The dataset is available here “https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud” contains
transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset
presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807
transactions.

I have applied various sampling technique like under sampling and SMOTE and after that I have applied various Machine Learning model.
